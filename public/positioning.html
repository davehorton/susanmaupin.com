		<h3>Challenge</h3> 
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>What would you do if your division of a Fortune 100 Company had a different target audience than the organization’s other key channel, but was messaging to them in the same way?
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>I realized that in order to gain more traction with our small business customers we needed to message to them differently than we were our consumer audience.  I proposed that our division undertake a re-branding exercise in which we lived under the over-arching brand umbrella of the company, but that enabled us to speak in a more relevant way to our audience.  After getting the green light from senior management, I established an internal working team that was engaged with the project from start to end and that set the groundwork for the positioning.  I merged our internal agency with the external agency to gain full buy-in and ultimate ownership of the project by our internal agency—and to ensure a better product.  I worked closely with the consumer insights team to engage in research that would inform the final positioning.  I drew upon expertise throughout the organization to infuse the best strategic thinking into the project.  And, I formed an essential cross-functional team of senior leaders who we engaged throughout each step of the effort and who served as the ultimate decision makers.

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>I was able to successfully navigate the multiple layers of hierarchy and decision makers to drive the project forward on-time and on-budget.  I rolled out the new brand platform for this $8B division to the overall company—educating employees, generating enthusiasm and fostering brand ambassadors.  I integrated the new branding throughout all touch points in the organization.  Ultimately, this division continued to grow quickly gaining more relevance and engagement with their customer base.</p>
