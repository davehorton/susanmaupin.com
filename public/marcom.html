		<h3>Challenge</h3> 
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>As a premier foreign luxury automotive brand in the U.S., how do you respond when your franchise dealers across the country, each want to create and develop their own advertising rather than use the globally approved brand advertising?  This was the challenge of a U.S. division of a global automotive brand that needed to drive awareness and consistency in messaging to increase consumer understanding of the brand and thereby grow sales.  
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>Given this challenge, I immediately set up meetings around the country with the sales team and dealers to better understand their advertising and media needs.  Through these discussions I recognized an opportunity to build a bridge between the global campaign and the advertising U.S. dealers wanted to do on local level to drive immediate sales.  I orchestrated a retail advertising campaign that aligned with the global brand strategy, but that also met the dealers’ goals.  In addition, I created a program that rewarded dealers who used the company’s brand advertising with free media in their market and other financial incentives.  
			</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>The parent company recognized that without U.S. dealer buy-in, their global campaign would fail.  They approved my retail advertising campaign developed for the U.S. and asked me to translate it into a global retail strategy. I communicated this strategy to over 2,000 company managers and executives at the international launch of the campaign.  They then rolled out the strategy in their markets worldwide.  Dealers appreciated a retail advertising strategy that took their needs into account, and their acceptance in the U.S. of corporate brand messaging increased to never before approached rates of nearly 100%.</p>
