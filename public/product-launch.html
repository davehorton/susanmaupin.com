	<h1>Product Launch</h1>
	<div class="case-study-description">
		<h3>Challenge</h3> 
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>What would be your approach if your Fortune 100 company decided to launch a new retail concept as a brand extension of its existing stores featuring unique and distinctive service offerings, requiring a paradigm shift on the part of your customers? 
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>  I quickly recognized that everyone in the organization was talking about the company’s new offering very differently. I put together an internal team and developed our positioning and messaging. I hired an advertising agency, provided them with strategic and creative direction, and worked with them to finalize language and create marketing, sales and promotional materials.</p>

			<p> I worked closely with other members of the team to design and create an exciting in-store experience—from layout of the store footprint, to signage to messaging throughout the stores.</p>

			<p>Additionally, to prep the launch:
			<ul>
				<li>I met with members of the Chamber of Commerce and key business leaders in each community, gaining their input and participation in our launch event. </li>
				<li>  I developed an "office makeover contest" in which business owners submitted essays as to why they should win an office makeover. At our launch events, we announced winners and gave each a check for their makeover.</li> 
				<li>  I reached out and established a joint co-marketing program with Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, HP and Symantec; developed a joint co-marketing program and marshaled resources across all companies to support the launch.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>As a result, we held the most successful launch events in this Fortune 100 company’s store history, and created a new template for future launch events.  We forged new and strong partnerships with key vendors.  And, we created a strong positioning that gave clarity to the organization’s offering and its benefits to the consumer, thus enabling the sales team to improve their effectiveness.</p>
