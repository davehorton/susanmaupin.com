		<h3>Challenge</h3> 
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>What would be your approach if your company decided to launch a new retail concept featuring distinctive service offerings—and asked you to lead the marketing end of things? 
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>I recognized very quickly that everyone in the organization was talking about the company’s new offering very differently.  The lack of a single cohesive, compelling message caused internal dissonance, customer confusion, and decreased sales effectiveness.  I put together an internal team and developed our positioning and messaging.  I hired a small advertising agency, provided them with strategic and creative direction, and they finalized language and created marketing and sales materials.</p>
			<p>I worked closely with other members of the team to design and create an exciting in-store experience—from layout of the store footprint to signage to messaging throughout the stores.  We arrived at new innovations for this Fortune 100 retailer that enhanced the customer experience and provided clarity around the organization’s offerings.</p>
			<p>I led the launch of each of the 12 retail stores undertaking a multi-prong approach to ensure success.   I went into each community and met with members of the Chamber of Commerce and key business leaders to tell them about our plans for our store opening in advance, gain their input and participation in our launch event.  I asked the Chamber to nominate an outstanding citizen and business leader for whom we created a plaque which we placed in the store and had the mayor and our company’s CEO honor at the opening.  I worked with the Chamber to develop a VIP invitation list for key Chamber members who we invited to tour the store with our CEO before its official opening.  I developed an office makeover contest in which business owners (our target audience) submitted essays as to why they should win an office makeover.  At our launch events, we announced the winners and gave them a check for their makeover.  I secured a marketing partnership with Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, HP and Symantec; developed a joint co-marketing program and marshaled resources across all companies.  We gave away product and held talks given by experts at these companies at the launch events to generate additional excitement and traffic at the launch.  In addition, we advertised and promoted the events and launches, and generated PR, to create further awareness and excitement.</p>
			<p>Most importantly, I recognized the expertise that each member of our small team brought to the table.  Marketing is naturally a hub that can bring people together and as is always the case, our team was able to accomplish more than any one individual would have been able to do.
			</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>As a result, we held the most successful launch events in this Fortune 100 company’s store history, creating a new template for the company for future launch events.  We forged a new and strong partnership with key vendors.  We created a strong positioning that gave clarity to the organization’s offering and its benefits to the consumer, thus enabling the sales team to improve their effectiveness.  And, we created a new store footprint that was later transferred to new and remodeled stores within the 1500 store chain.</p>
