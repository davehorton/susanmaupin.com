	<h1>Launching a Start-up</h1>
	<div class="case-study-description">
		<h3>Challenge</h3> 
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>What do you do if your non-profit organization is trying to help people in poverty-stricken rural areas start their own businesses through a new micro-lending model—but the very people you are trying to serve have an inherent distrust in outsiders and the idea of borrowing money?
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>Given this challenge, I went door to door in struggling small towns looking for individuals who already had a small business or who were interested in starting one.  I described the organization’s offering and listened to feedback and reservations, encouraging those who were curious or interested, to take steps to learn more.  I partnered with respected community organizations and held town hall meetings to get the word out about the program.  I developed a curriculum and then held a training program on how to start a business, encouraging participants to support one another.  I also recommended changes to the international business- lending model that we were using in the U.S. to create a more realistic and practical solution for our market. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>As a result of the proposed changes I recommended to the lending model, the organization began to gain increased traction and participation in the program.  I helped to train over 500 people on how to start a business and helped to start over 300 small businesses.  As a testament to the program’s success, other organizations around the country picked up many of our practices and approaches and applied them to their markets.</p>
