		<h3>Challenge</h3> 
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>do you do if you are an organic yogurt company and your consumers associate your key brand attribute (organic) with bad flavor?  Consumers would ask, “How can it taste good, if it’s healthy!?”
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Solution</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>To overcome this hurdle, we wanted to get samples in peoples’ hands so they would at least try the product.  The company knew that once consumers tried their yogurt, they were often surprised to discover that they loved the taste.</p>
			<p>I envisioned, planned and implemented a 13-city national tour (the <strong>“LoveFest tour”</strong>) that combined sampling to get the company’s product in consumers’ hands with fun ways to educate about the benefits of organic.  We integrated with select national live events and festivals, creating novel ways for consumers to interact with and experience the company’s product and brand.  As we visited each town, we would also deliver yogurt to fire stations, non-profits, the local paper or radio station, and other organizations.   We further increased awareness of our presence by rewarding those companies that tweeted about us the most, with yogurt.</p>
			<p> In addition, I developed and managed a partnership with the United States Tennis Association’s 700,000 members and distributed samples at the US Open with 730,000 attendees.

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="textblock">
			<p>As a result of the 13-city tour, we delivered a quarter of a million samples.  At the US Open we generated 320,000 impressions and 375,000 product trials.  Both events generated significant press and provided an authentic customer experience that deeply reflected the company’s brand, mission and values.</p>
